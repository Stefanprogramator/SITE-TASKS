      Venice, Italy is a city located in the south of western Europe. It is best known for its beauty, architecture, and art. Its historical buildings and canals are what most people know of Venezia but the city is rich of a unique culture and lifestyle shaped by its location in the middle of a lagoon and centuries of a unique political and economic history. Often called the Serenissima, after the successful Republic which governed the city, Venice has always been a favorite of artists. Many habits, words, and things currently part of our daily life were born in this small but immensely important city.

    <h1>
      Iconic Architecture
    </h1>
    <h4>
      To erect a new building on sandy Venetian ground, Venetians would hammer two rows of piles all along its perimeter. After that, they would fill the space between these rows with mud.

      The following step was to remove the water and mud between the two rows of piles and let them partially dry.
      
      After that, it was necessary to plant more long piles of wood close to each other, deep into the soft ground.  The piles had to be long enough to reach the firmer soil several meters below the surface.
      
      After planting the piles, Venetians would cut the length protruding from the ground. This way, piles were all at the same level.
      
      The following step was to fill the space between piles with stones and concrete.
      
      Finally, Venetians placed big wooden plates on the piles’ heads, creating the ground floor upon which the rest of the building would be built.

      What is so special about Venice Italy?
    </h1>
    <h4>
      Many aspects contribute to make Venice such a special city.

      It’s impossible to speak about Venice without mentioning its incredible History, its unique Culture, its centuries-old Traditions, and its marvelous Architecture. So let’s start…
    </h4>
    <h1>
      Venetian Culture
    </h1>
    <h4>
      The cultural heritage in Venice is vital and can still be seen and felt amongst many Venetians of today. In fact, many Venetians know well, respect, and preserve Venetian culture, traditions, and way of life.

The respect of the Venetian culture and way of life, in particular, can be seen as a natural consequence of the geography of the city itself. One such example is the Voga alla Veneta or Venetian Rowing, which is part of the Venetian culture ever since the foundation of the city.
